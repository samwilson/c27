1.3 - July 23, 2009

Uninitialized variables corrected throughout.
Use of 2 instances of create_function() eliminated for performance gain
Cleaned up HTML character handling in process_feed().  No errors were identified prior to edit, but now it is consistent with how process() works.

1.2 - July 23, 2009

moved the processing of widow handling after hyphenation so that max-pull would not be compared to the length of the adjacent word, but rather the length of the adjacent word segment (i.e. that after a soft hyphen)

1.1 - July 22, 2009

By default, when class phpTypography is constructed, set_defaults is called.  However, if you are going to manually set all settings, you can now bypass the set_defaults call for slightly improved performance.  Just call `$typo = new phpTypography(FALSE)`
Added `html_entity_decode` to process_feed to avoid invalid character injection (according to XML's specs)

1.0.3 - July 17, 2009 =

Reverted use of the hyphen character to the basic minus-hyphen in words like "mother-in-law" because of poor support in IE6

Changed thin space injection behavior so that for text such as "...often-always?-judging...", the second dash will be wrapped in thin spaces
Corrected error where fractions were not being styled because of a zero-space insertion with the wrap hard hyphens functionality

added "/" as a valid word character so we could capture "this/that" as a word for processing (similar to "mother-in-law")
Corrected error where characters from the Latin 1 Supplement Block were not recognized as word characters
Corrected smart quote handling for strings of numbers
Added smart guillemet conversion as part of smart quotes: &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; to « and »

Added Single Low 9 Quote, Double Low 9 Quote and » to style_initial_character functionality
Added a new phpTypography method smart_math that assigns proper characters to minus, multiplication and division characters
Depreciated the phpTypography method smart_multiplication in favor of smart_math
Cleaned up some smart quote functionality
Added ability to wrap after "/" if set_wrap_hard_hyphen is TRUE (like "this/that")
